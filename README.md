### These are the tasks currently performed or on going:
#### 1. Fieldwork to obtain road­killed animal data for the mobile mapping trailer (MMS1).
#### 2. Real tests for the mobile mapping trailer (MMS1) in part of the N4 road of the intervention area.
#### 3. Control tests on 20 meters of road for the mobile mapping trailer (MMS1) with road­killed amphibians from the biological collection of Universidade de Évora.
#### 4. Update of the algorithm for detecting road­killed amphibians on the images recorded by the mobile mapping trailer (MMS1).
#### 5. Collection of images of road­killed small birds to feed the detection algorithm by the mobile mapping trailer (MMS1).
#### 6. Adaptation of the algorithms to detect road­killed small birds on the images recorded by the mobile mapping trailer.
#### 7. Development of a desktop application for automatic detection of road­kills on the images recorded by the mobile mapping trailer.
#### 8. Acquisition of the components for the new mobile mapping system (MMS2). Several components have already arrived:
#### 9. Creation of the software to connect all the devices.10. Analysis of the potential components for the dissuasion devices for rodents, owls, and large birds.
#### 10. Analysis of the potential components for the dissuasion devices for rodents, owls, and large birds.
